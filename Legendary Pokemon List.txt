*Darkrai: After beating the Elite 4 many children and eventually adults will start falling into deep sleeps where they have nightmares that they cannot wake up from. This coincidentally happens when contruction of a hotel is being started on Newmoon island. Eventually Cynthia gets word of this and together you both determine Darkrai is behind this. When trying to find someone to sail you to Newmoon island, someone Cynthia is close friends with becomes a victim of Darkrai and she flies there herself. After this, visit the sailor at the harbor in Blissmar city and he will take you there since he also knows someone who is a victim of this and is depserate for it to stop. Once at Newmoon island you meet Lucas who says Cynthia has been taken over by Darkrai and is too strong for him to beat, as he also barely escaped with his life. Go up to Cynthia and talk to her, She will start saying things to you that is actually Darkrai controlling her, she challenges you to a battle and her team is her main team with each Pokemon's individual stats boosted by 30 each. If you beat her then Darkrai concedes and stops controlling her. She heals your Pokemon and you then face Darkrai, and when you sail back to Blissmar city you will be rewarded by the Sailor (nuggets or something idk). Lucas will battle you after you get back. If you lose to Cynthia then after some dialogue, Darkrai will send you into a deep sleep that you cannot wake up from and the game will autosave. If this happens you have lost and need to restart the game from the beginning. Construction is then stopped indefinitely on the island.  This is the first main storyline after the Elite 4 are beaten and will start automatically. No other storyline or legendaries will be started until you have comepleted this.

*Arceus: After having CAUGHT (not Registered, but Caught) every other Pokemon in the national Pokedex visit Professor Oak and he will review your Pokedex. He will congratulate you and make a phone call to have an item sent to him. That item is the Azure Flute. He tells you to go to the top of Mt. Artemis and play the flute. After playing it Arceus will appear and battle you, at level 100. Catch it and go back to Professor Oak with it in your party, he will be amazed and tell you to go see the man who sent him the flute, which will start the very last quest of the game, beat the game developer (me :D) in a battle. The first time you battle me you cannot use any Pokemon with stats over 600 (including Arceus but not including Galandart). Every other time you want to battle me you can use whatever Pokemon you want and a "Legend Battle" will also be unlocked where I have a full team of legendaries.

After hearing this deal go to the "herb store" in Igneous City and say you want "The good stuff". You must battle the cashier in order to buy some. If you win, you can buy a kilo of cocaine for 50,000 Pokedollars. You can buy more than one but it is a key item so you cannot use it, but you can have it for bragging rights. Bring a Kilo back to the man and he will say thanks and not give you anything. Leave the house and then enter again and try and talk to him. He will not respond as he has tried to snort the entire Kilo and has died. You can take things off his body including some money, some repels, and a Thundurus.

*Landorus: Visit the Shrine in Kanazawa city with Tornadus and Thundurus in your party.

*Reshiram OR Zekrom: Talk to N at the top of Mt. Oava, He will battle you. He will also ask you which you prefer, black or white (this will be asked earlier in the game actually), out of curiosity. He will say that he thinks they are up to no good and thinks they are conspiring with the Russians. Go to Zenit City after this and Ghetsis is using the materials from the Russians to try and make a machine capable of summoning Kyurem. He sends Russian Grunts to battle you since they are at his disposal after an agreement with Vladamir. After beating those Russian Grunts, he flees into Kungur cave to try and summon Kyurem, to get to him you must battle a lot of Russian Grunts along the way and when you reach him, he will battle you right before he is going to summon Kyurem. If you win the battle against him, he does not admit defeat and will keep on with his plan until N shows up with Looker who arrests him, stopping his plan from happening. After you have done this, N will heal your Pokemon and battle you. If you beat him then you can go to a house and get his legendary dragon later, which will be Reshiram if you chose White when he asked you, or Zekrom if you chose Black. If you lose, N and Looker will still come but too late, as he summons Kyurem and kills you in the cave in order to start global domination with Kyurem at his side. You and everyone in the cave are immediately killed and the screen goes black and autosaves. If this happens you have lost and need to restart the game from the beginning. 

*Reshiram OR Zekrom: After recieving N's Dragon, talk to the sailor in Igneous City at the harbor and he will say N recently visited to go to an island. Pay him a fee (undecided) and he will take you to an island filled with Unova Pokemon (but not Unova). N is there and is caring for the other Dragon which now resides on the island. He says it was owned by the trainer Ghetsis killed when two trainers were looking to meet him and he still feels guilty about it. He says that you should battle the Dragon as it senses you as a worthy trainer. 

*Kyurem: Go to the science building in St. Phenix (not decided which building) and talk to one of the scientists on the top floor. He says he was given the machine Ghetsis tried to use to summon Kyurem in order to take it apart carefully and dispose of it, but he says he cannot figure it out. If you have both Reshiram and Zekrom in your party the machine will make a noise and the scientist will give it to you, seeing as it reacts to your Pokemon and thinks that is the way to disable it. Then go to Kungur cave and the machine will make more noise until Kyurem is summoned and you can battle it. Take the machine back to the scientist and he will reward you for doing his work for him with an Old Amber (which is how you get Aerodactyl)

***Keldeo: After obtaining Cobalion, Virizion, and Terrakion, Go to a man's house in Cesbit town, and he will tell you the story of Keldeo, and that with the help of the three swords of Justice, Keldeo will come out. Then go to the Sailor in Cesbit town and the tell him to take you to Justice Island (Not yet made) which is where Keldeo will be (assuming all 3 Swords of Justice are in your party)

+Meloetta: Available from an Old man in St. Phenix

+Genesect: After obtaining Victini, go to St. Phenix with it in your party and gang members will try to battle you and take it in order to win more matches. If you lose to one of the gang members they rob you in order to obtain Victini, if this happens the game autosaves and you have lost all your pokemon in your party and have them be replaced with a level 10 Magikarp. If you beat them go into their base where there are more until you reach the gang boss. He will challenge you to a winner take all battle, if he wins then he gets Victini from you, and if you win you get Genesect from him. He has Genesect in his party.
