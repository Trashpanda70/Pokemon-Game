# Pokemon-Game Temporary Guide

This is a temporary guide to the Pokemon Game I have been working on

If you are reading this and have access to the game, please let me know if there are any bugs or glitches you find that are not already listed

Enjoy the game, and please read this document before playing or asking any questions about the game. Or don't, I can't force you to

I am always looking to hear feedback on what I could add to make the game better. 
If I do not want to add your idea it's most likely because it would be too much work, I don't know how to do it, or it would conflict with another feature already in the game 

## To-Do List

### Known Bugs/Issues
- Visual bug where the menu screen is still showing while the player is using the Lava Rod item, but the encounter process still works as intended
- Some background audio does not loop perfectly, it should be not very noticable but please let me know if you think it ruins the experience
- Galandart Sprite does not move when fighting. This feature would take a lot of time to fix and is something I intend to leave in the game unless I can figure out a fast way to fix it. As of now, the only way I know to fix it is to manually photoshop more than 100 photos of Regigigas, which already has a battle sprite, to make a stop motion type image panel for Galandart so that it moves during battle. I am not willing to do that since I know photoshop but do not have that amount of skill/patience
- Female player sprite breaks when throwing a Pokeball upon entering battle
- Butcher does not display formatted text during transactions
- The tent outside of Heavenly Pillar is not in the same art style as the rest of the game
- Music changes volume when moving between Heavenly Pillar Outside and Route 18 even though it is the same music. It does not restart or break looping but rather just change volume
- Music volume will reset if game is exited but the slider values in the settings will remain the same. I have no idea how to fix this, so I would recommend adjusting the volume of the game on your computer as opposed to in-game
- Spirit Pokemon are catchable when they should not be
- Spirit Pokemon appear on the National Pokedex when they should not
- Again, please let me know if there are any bugs/glitches you find that are not listed

### Features Not Yet Implemented
- All wild pokemon encounters
- Any interior of buildings past route 1 apart from Pokemon Centers, Poke-Marts, and some Butcher Shops
- Any characters past route 1 except for the nurse in the Pokemon Center, the sales clerk in the Poke-Marts, and the Butcher in the Butcher Shop
- Honey Tree encounter mechanic
- A regional Pokedex (might not get added)
- Certain small caves or rooms in caves that legendary Pokemon appear in
- Some miscellaneous islands that may or may not be post game. Undecided as to how many to add
- The map for the final battle against the Game Dev (me if you couldnt guess)
- Map for Arceus Event
- Way to secretly access Arceus Event early?
- Way to secretly access Mew Event early?
- Character sprites for specific IRL people/friends I want to add
- Give the game a better name than "Pokemon Gray"
- Region Name
- Gym Badge Sprites to use
- Items to eventually replace HM's
- Me actually learning to code in Ruby
- A bunch of other stuff I probably forgot

## Game Changes / Summary of Inclusions

### Included Pokemon / People
- All Pokemon from Generations 1-5 have animated battle sprites
- The custom legendary Pokemon for the region Galandart (more later)
- Sprit form of 21 already existing Pokemon (not catchable, more later)

Generation 6 Pokemon sprites are harder to find due to their 3D-Nature, which is why the game stops at Generation 5 sprites.
Also, Generation 6 is where I stop recognizing every Pokemon since I am a 20 something boomer (I still recognize most though).
Because there are no Gen 6 Pokemon, the Fairy type is not added. If requested, I can change the type matchups of current types to 
buff Steel and Poison and nerf Dragon, but so far no changes have been made.

I plan to include some people I know IRL into this game but need character sprites for them, and obviously their permission.

Most of your favorite (and maybe least favorite) characters will make an appearance. This includes Team Plasma, N, Ghetsis, Cyrus, Cynthia, Red, Red's Mom?, Dawn, Lucas, Grimsly, The Sinnoh Elite 4, The Kanto Elite 4 including Lance, Steven, Zinnia, and probably more I forgot. There is no appearance from Team Aqua or Magma because the Groudon-Kyogre events will be triggered a different way, but Rayquaza still plays the same role. Team Rocket Jessie, James, and Meowth will also appear. 

Managing all of these character encounters will be hard as to not seem overbearing, so some characters will appear more than others. This will mostly be based on 3 factors:
- My knowledge of the character to create dialogue and encounters that mirror what the character would actually do
- How much I like the character and want to see them in the game
- How well I think I can fit the character into the storyline

Keep in mind that most of my Pokemon experience is in generations 4 and 5, with some in generations 6 and 7 (but I cant add those features anyway). This means if you are a gen 3 fan then sorry I guess but a lot of the nostalga for those games will not be here (other than the fact that most graphics are gen 3 I think)

### Changes/Notes From Previous Pokemon Games
- New Butcher mechanic (more later)
- New Shadow Pokemon mechanic (read the whole document everything is explained i swear)
- New Lava Fishing mechanic: Essentially just fishing but in Lava for fire types, you cannot surf on Lava
- Added Lava
- TM's can be used infinitely 
- Shiny chance increased fropm 1/8192 to 1/512 since there are no real shiny hunting methods planned
- Pokerus chance increased from 1/32768 to 5/32768
    - Added COVID easter egg
- Added Deep Snow, which will make the player move slower and have wild Pokemon
    - This tile appears on Route 12
- Added a Sand tile for Pokemon Encounters
    - This tile appears in Kalimari Desert
- The AI can now use Revives, Max Revives, Revival Herbs, and Sacred Ash. Good luck fighting Cynthia now :)
    - If you can heal so can they it is fair 
    - No I will not remove the feature (Unless an upgrade to the essentials package forces me to but I might just not upgrade)
    - Yes I will make sure it is still balanced
- Added custom music for Darkrai, Latios/Latias, Galandart, Celebi, The Champion Battle, Team Russia Battles, and more
    - I cannot make music because I simply do not know anything about it, see the credits file for full credits on Music, Sprites, and other game functions/details
    - On a side note, most music is taken from generations 4 and 5, with some from 6, 7, and 8 (if 8 is sword and shield idk I have one song from there)
- There will be items that will replace the HM's you earn from gyms. These items will be unlocked after you've already gotten the HM, so HM's will not be useless. I plan on making the move deleter accessible early in the game for convenience (Surely I wont forget I said this).
- Honey trees will not have a waiting time, the encounter will be instant

### Changes to Previous Pokemon
#### Slaking
The first Pokemon that has been changed is Slaking because I've always hated the fact that he is unusable. To help with this, his ability has been replaced, but he has been nerfed to have the power level of a Pseudolegendary. This might be nerfed more later. If you want to argue that he is in fact usable then my coutnerarguemnt is I am bad at the game.

New Ability: Intimidate

EVs: 2 HP, 1 Attack

|  Old Base Stats  |  New Base Stats  |	
| ---------------- | ---------------- |	
| HP - 150 | HP - 120 |
| Attack - 160 | Attack - 140 |
| Defense - 100	| Defense - 90 |
|Sp. Attack - 95 | Sp. Attack - 85 |
|Sp. Defense - 65 | Sp. Defense - 65 |
|Speed - 100 | Speed - 100 |
|TOTAL = 670 | TOTAL = 600 |

#### Arceus
For being literally God, Arceus' base stats are not as impresive as they should be. While there is not Mega Evolution in the game (remember the whole can't add gen 6 thing), I still wanted to buff Arceus as having an Arceus and being able to sweep is not something I am worried about. All of Arceus' stats have been bosted to be 135 each for a base total of **810** instead of the previous total of 720.

#### Evolutions
This game has no online functionality because obviously. To make up for this, all Pokemon are catchable in-game. This also means that some evolution tactics will need to be changed since they required trading. I could just keep most trading evolutions and have NPC trades, but I thought this would be an easier solution for the player. Let me know if you disagree and I will consider reverting some of these changed. Also, generation 5 has some ridiculously late evolutions, so I have changed some of them so that the player does not have to wait until level 60+ to use a Pokemon they like. The following list gives exact details to new evolution methods for various Pokemon:

Feebas - 
Now evolves into Milotic at level 30

Graveler - 
Now evolves to Golem by trade or at level 40

Slowpoke - 
Now evolves into Slowking if it levels up during the day holding a kings rock
The Slowbro evolution has not been changed

Onix - 
Now evolves into Steelix by trading while holding the metal coat and by leveling up while knowing the move Iron Tail. 
These are two separate conditions, and Onix will evolve if either is met

Horsea - 
Now evolves into Seadra at level 24

Seadra - 
Now evolves into Kingdra at level 47

Clamperl - 
Now evolves into Huntail if it levels up during the day holding a Deep Sea Tooth or evolves into Gorebyss if it levels up during the day holding a Deep Sea Scale

### New Butcher Mechanic
People need to eat in the Pokemon world. Butcher houses provide food to people and will take Pokemon trainers catch and give them money.

It is undecided whether actual meat items will be obtainable by the player when they give a Pokemon to the butcher.

The amount of money given to a player is dependent on the Pokemon's type.
- There are 4 Tiers, With tier 0 being least valuable and tier 3 being the most valuable
    - Tier 0: Rock, Steel, Poison, Ghost
    - Tier 1: Electric, Ground, Psychic, Ice, and Dark
    - Tier 2: Normal, Dragon, Bug, and Fighting
    - Tier 3: Flying, Water, Fire, and Grass

- The only pure Flying Type is Tornadus and it is not able to be sold anyway so the price will not be impacted by Flying type. But in order to prevent any possible errors it is listed under Tier 3.
- If a Pokemon has two types then the type used will be the type of lowest tier.
- You cannot sell Pokemon until you have 2 Gym Badges
- You obviously cannot sell a Pokemon if it is the only one in your party
- You cannot sell Eggs as this is a butcher not a diner
- The money you will recieve is as follows:
		- Tier 0: Will not buy
		- Tier 1: $500 + An amount equal to the Pokemon's height in centimeters
		- Tier 2: $750 + An amount equal to the Pokemon's height in centimeters
		- Tier 3: $1000 + An amount equal to the Pokemon's height in centimeters
- The use of height over weight is stemmed from the fact that I could not find where a Pokemon's weight is stored in the code, and I am not going to manually insert a weight mechanic. The height will be used unless I find a way to access a Pokemon's weight.
- You cannot sell Legendaries, Mythicals, or Ditto

### New Custom Legendary: Galandart
The name Galandart is the name given to the sprite by the original creator on DeviantArt

Galandart is essentially the "cover legendary" of the game, and represents the souls/spirits of Pokemon from the past

All battles that ban the use of Pokemon with base stats over 600 will allow the use of Galandart even though its base stat total is above 600. This is to not discourage the player from using the custom Pokemon on their team. The only exceptions to this rule are battles in the Battle Colosseum. The information about the Pokemon is listed below:

#### Info
- Type: Ghost/Steel
- Ability: (Custom) Undecided
    - The ability was originally going to raise the defense and special defense if hit by a Ghost type move. I felt that this was a little overpowered considering the fact that Ghost is one of the only types Galandart is weak to. Therefore, the effect of the ability is undecided as of now.

Since the battle mechanics are that of gen 5, both of Ghost type's weaknesses are negated by Steel, and Steel's fighting weakness is eliminated by the Ghost type, making this type combination very powerful and only weak to fire and ground (unless type matchups are changed).

- Gender: Genderless
- Growth Rate: Slow
- Effort Points: 2 Defense, 1 Special Defense
- Catch Rate: 3 (1.6% with Pokeball on full HP, same as other legendaries)
- Custom Battle Theme (Tokyo Ghoul - Licht und Schetten) -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S1NmtWDVYk
    - No, I have not seen Tokyo Ghoul, but rather just found the song. If you know how to watch it please let me know :)

#### Base Stats
- HP: 110
- Attack: 120
- Defense: 120
- Special Attack: 100
- Special Defense: 150
- Speed: 80
- Total: 680
These may be updated for balancing, but the total will stay at 680

#### Moves
level - move name
- 1 - Night Shade
- 1 - Gyro Ball
- 1 - Shadow Ball
- 1 - Cosmic Power
- 10 - Flash Cannon
- 20 - Iron Defense
- 30 - Ancient Power
- 40 - Destiny Bond
- 50 - Spiritual Gaze (Custom)
- 50 - Rushing Lance (Custom)
- 60 - Feint Attack
- 70 - Scary Face
- 80 - Heatwave
- 90 - Mirror Coat
- 100 - Iron Head
- 100 - Spiritual Gaze (Custom)
- 100 - Rushing Lance (Custum)
The moves list may be updated for balancing in the future

I will not list all TMs/HMs that Galandart can learn in this document, you will have to figure that out yourself

##### Custom Moves
These moves may be updated at any time for balancing in terms of power and accuracy, but the effect will remain the same. Both moves have a similar mechanic that Arceus does with the type plates and its move Judgement. The moves will use different items, so you can only change the type of one at a time.

**Spiritual Gaze**
- Damage: 90
- Accuracy: 100
- PP: 10
- Default Type: Ghost
- Attack Type: Special
- Ignores Protect and Detect
- Can be copied by Mirror Move
Items that chenges move type are different "Eyes". The types available are Fire, Grass, Bug, Psychic, Dark, Flying, and Water

**Rushing Lance**
- Damage: 100
- Accuracy: 90
- PP: 10
- Default Type: Steel
- Attack Type: Physical
- Makes Physical Contact with the foe
- Can be copied by Mirror Move
- May introduce a recoil effect
Items that changes move type are different "Lances". The tpyes available are Fire, Electric, Fighting, Rock, Ice, Ground, and Poison

### Spirit Pokemon
Keeping with the theme of the game so far, Spirit Pokemon will be wild encounters of past Pokemon used in previous Human wars. After all, why would humans fight each other if they can train much more poweful creatures to attack at their command. Spirit Pokemon will be uncatchable, and will not appear in the Pokedex since they are just spirit versions of already existing Pokemon. Their sprite will be grayscale, and other than that will be the same as the non-spirit form of the Pokemon.

All Spirit Pokemon will have the ability Levitate, and will have base stats equal to their non-spirit form with each individual stat boosted by 10. The EV's dropped from battle will therefore be the same as their non-spirit form. The typing of Spirit Pokemon will be a dual typing of Ghost and the/one of the type(s) that the Pokemon's non-spirit form is.

The moveset of all Spirit Pokemon will follow the following formula:
- Move 1: Night Shade
- Move 2: Spiritual Gaze (custom move, same as Galandart)
- Move 3: Move that the non-spirit form of the Pokemon knows, normally matching the non-Ghost typing of the Spirit Pokemon but not always
- Move 4: Other move the non-spirit form of the Pokemon knows

I will not be revealing the exact move 3 and 4 for any of the Spirit Pokemon, you should use knowledge of the non-spirit form of the Pokemon to guess what moves the Spirit Pokemon will have at it's disposal. Spirit Pokemon can only learn these four moves, so if you figure out the moveset of a particular Spirit Pokemon then you know the moveset of every Spirit Pokemon of that kind. 

The type of Spiritual Gaze for each Spirit Pokemon will change depending on what Pokemon it is. Since an Eye needs to be held by a Pokemon to change the type of this move, if the move is not Ghost type then the wild Spirit Pokemon is holding an Eye to change the move's type. The only way to obtain eyes in this game will be via stealing them from these Spirit Pokemon, but remember that you cannot catch them. This is the current plan for obtaining Eyes, and it could change.

The list of Pokemon that can appear in Spirit Form is shown below. These Pokemon will not appear until later into the playthrough (when you are level 35-40 or something). I will disclose the type that each Pokemon's Spiritual Gaze will be, so you can hunt for a particular Eye if you want.
- Pokemon (type1/type2) type that Spiritual Gaze will be
- Pikachu (Electric/Ghost) Ghost
- Nidoking (Poison/Ghost) Psychic
- Nidoqueen (Poison/Ghost) Psychic
- Machoke (Fighting/Ghost) Ghost
- Machamp (Fighting/Ghost) Ghost
- Poliwrath (Water/Ghost) Water
- Arcanine (Fire/Ghost) Fire
- Pinsir (Bug/Ghost) Bug
- Houndoom (Dark/Ghost) Dark
- Makuhita (Fighting/Ghost) Ghost
- Hariyama (Fighting/Ghost) Ghost
- Rhydon (Ground/Ghost) Ghost
- Ramparados (Rock/Ghost) Dark
- Lucario (Fighting/Ghost) Dark
- Gabite (Dragon/Ghost) Fire
- Croagunk (Poison/Ghost) Psychic
- Toxicroak (Poison/Ghost) Psychic
- Abomasnow (Grass/Ghost) Grass
- Darmanitan (Fire/Ghost) Fire
- Escavalier (Bug/Ghost) Bug
- Beartic (Ice/Ghost) Water
The spawn rates for each Spirit Pokemon individually has not been decided, but assume it will be relatively equal between all of them. They will only appear in certain places in the game, so you should not be caught off guard by randomly encountering one in the wild (it will be obvious where they can be found)

### Honey Trees
As mentioned previously, the honey tree mechanic from Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum will be in this game, but with no delay between applying the honey and getting an encounter. The honey trees will have the same look as they did in gen 4, so they should be easy to find as they are also located in many places. The method for obtaining honey is not exactly decided, but it will probably just be found as an item and able to be bought from somewhere.

There are two ways I could implement the honey tree mechanic, the first being similar to normal wild encounters and having about 7-10 possible encounters per honey tree with encounter rates ranging from 1-20 percent. The second way would be to execute a Honey Tree script when the player slathers honey on a tree, and pass in either a set or random list of Pokemon to the script for it to choose an encounter at random. 

Method 1 would mean that the encounters are like normal encounters and thus more predictable in terms of how many Pokemon will be in the tree, even though one Pokemon can take up more than one percentage value (for example, one Pokemon listed under a 20% encounter rate and a 5% encounter rate has a 25% encounter rate). This is the method used in gen 4 and in essentially almost every other non-static Pokemon encounter, so it would be what the player is used to.

Method 2 would mean that encounters are actually treated like events rather than normal encounters. This doesn't really impact gameplay as much as the programming, but it would also give me more control over what the encounters look like. I could have a honey tree with two possible encounters, or a honey tree with 100 possible encounters. It would also allow me to change the encounter level and Pokemon of each honey tree as the player progresses through the game, since I could pass different values into the script depending on things like the players average Pokemon level and number of Gym Badges. 

Let me know which way you would prefer if you have a preference, and if seeing variability in Honey Trees is something that you would like. Currently, I do not know which way I want to implement honey trees, but the script method would work similar to Wonder Trade and is something I could probably do without too much effort other than finding variable names. The first method I do not know how to do off the top of my head, and would need to look it up online, but I may also need to learn it anyway for Snow tile encounters on Route 12. 

### WonderTrade
The WonderTrade feature will work similar to WonderTrade in previous Pokemon games, but with no online functionality. Essentially, you choose a Pokemon you want to trade and recieve a random Pokemon in return. Credits for the WonderTrade script are in the Game Credits text file.
- You cannot receive Legendaries or Mythicals through WonderTrade
- The Original Trainer of a Pokemon you receive from WonderTrade will be randomly picked from a predetermined list of names, with some easter egg names included
- WonderTrade can only be done at WonderTrade centers which are located in St. Phenix, Soufrabi City, and the Battle Colosseum. Two of these locations are post-game, as WonderTrade is designed to be a way to fill the Pokedex and maybe have some fun with RNG, not a way to get OP Pokemon early in the game.
- WonderTrade will be unlocked after you have 5 gym badges
- WonderTrade will cost money until you have beaten the Champion, after that it will be free
- The Pokemon you receive will be the same (or similar but probably same) level as the Pokemon you traded away.
- The WonderTrade script includes parameters for a list of Pokemon you cannot give, cannot receive, and Pokemon that are hard to get
    - Hard to get Pokemon essentially go through two RNG checks. A Pokemon is chosen at random to be received, but if that Pokemon is in the hard to get list, then there is only a 20% chance that the game will go through with giving you that Pokemon. If it does not go through with giving you that Pokemon, then a new Pokemon is chosen at random (this Pokemon may also be in the hard to get list). This list will gernerally be reserved for pseudolegendaries, and other strong third evolution Pokemon that should not be received often. 
    - The only Pokemon you cannot trade away are Galandart, Arceus, and Mew

As you progress through the game, the rules for WonderTrade will change. Note that while it is not listed, you can never receive Legendaries or Mythicals from WonderTrade (as stated above).
- After the 5th Gym:
    - WonderTrade unlocked
    - Cannot receive any pseudolegendaries, pseudo legendary second pre-evolutions (mid stage), starters, starter evolutions, fossil Pokemon, Ditto, Rotom
    - Will cost money (amount undecided)
    - Might be a limit on the number you can do until you get stronger. Not yet implemented, but this mechanic is not supposed to be used too much before post game
- After the Elite 4 and Champion have been beaten once: WonderTrade will become permanantly free, you still cannot receive Ditto, Rotom, or any Kanto Starters since those are the starters used in the game as starter Pokemon
- After the Elite 4 and Chamption have been beaten twice and the Sinnoh Elite 4 and Champion have been beaten: You still cannot receive Ditto or Rotom
- After Red has been beaten, and a few other events/storylines have occured: You can obtain Ditto and Rotom from Wondertrade (albeit on the hard to get list)

## Conclusion
This write up is given to provide information about new/changed mechanics, not storyline information. There will be NPCs in the beta/test versions of the game that provide the ability to listen to battle music, do WonderTrade, and explain a few other things. The first release, if it has not been released yet, will be an exploration release where the main objective is for a few players to get access to the map and explore it and give feedback on design before I start implementing gameplay. If you have any suggestions, even if the map exploration is not out yet, please feel free to let me know and I will make note of them and maybe implement them in the future. 

Since I am in college, schoolwork will be a priority over completing this game. I do not have much free time, so the design process is slow.
