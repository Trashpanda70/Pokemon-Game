# Pokemon-Game Temporary Guide

This is a temporary guide to the Pokemon Game I have been working on

If you are reading this and have access to the game, please let me know if there are any bugs or glitches you find that are not already listed

Enjoy the game, and please read this document before playing or asking any questions about the game

I am always looking to hear feedback on what I could add to make the game better. 
If I do not want to add your idea it's most likely because it would be too much work, I don't know how to do it, or it would conflict with another feature already in the game 
## To-Do List

### Known Bugs/Issues
- Visual bug where the menu screen is still showing while the player is using the Lava Rod item, but the encounter process still works as intended
- Some background audio does not loop perfectly, it should be not very noticable but please let me know if you think it ruins the experience
- Galandart Sprite does not move when fighting. This feature would take a lot of time to fix and is something I intend to leave in the game unless I can figure out a fast way to fix it
- Female trainer sprite breaks when throwing a Pokeball upon entering battle
- Butcher does not display formatted text during transactions
- The tent outside of Heavenly Pillar is not in the same art style as the rest of the game
- Music changes volume when moving between Heavenly Pillar Outside and Route 18 even though it is the same music. It does not restart or break looping but rather just change volume
- Music volume will reset if game is exited but the slider values in the settings will remain the same. I do not know how to fix this
- Spirit Pokemon are catchable when they shuold not be
- Spirit Pokemon appear on the National Pokedex when they should not
- Again, please let me know if there are any bugs/glitches you find that are not listed

### Features Not Yet Implemented
- All wild pokemon encounters
- Any interior of buildings past route 1 apart from Pokemon Centers, Poke-Marts, and some Butcher Shops
- Any characters past route 1 except for the nurse in the Pokemon Center, the sales clerk in the Poke-Marts, and the Butcher in the Butcher Shop
- Honey Tree encounter mechanic
- A regional Pokedex (might not get added)
- Certain small caves or rooms in caves that legendary Pokemon appear in
- Some miscellaneous islands that may or may not be post game. Undecided as to how many to add
- The map for the final battle against the Game Dev (me if you couldnt guess)
- Map for Arceus Event
- Way to secretly access Arceus Event early?
- Way to secretly access Mew Event early?
- Character sprites for specific IRL people/friends I want to add
- Give the game a better name than "Pokemon Gray"
- Region Name
- Gym Badge Sprites to use
- Items to eventually replace HM's
- Me actually learning to code in Ruby
- A bunch of other stuff I probably forgot

## Game Changes / Summary of Inclusions

### Included Pokemon / People
- All Pokemon from Generations 1-5 have animated battle sprites
- The custom legendary Pokemon for the region Galandart (more later)
- Sprit form of 21 already existing Pokemon (not catchable, more later)

Generation 6 Pokemon sprites are harder to find due to their 3D-Nature, which is why the game stops at Generation 5 sprites.
Also, Generation 6 is where I stop recognizing every Pokemon since I am a 20 something boomer (I still recognize most though).
Because there are no Gen 6 Pokemon, the Fairy type is not added. If requested, I can change the type matchups of current types to 
buff Steel and Poison and nerf Dragon, but so far no changes have been made.

I plan to include some people I know IRL into this game but need character sprites for them, and obviously their permission.

Most of your favorite (and maybe least favorite) characters will make an appearance. This includes Team Plasma, N, Ghetsis, Cyrus, Cynthia, Red, Red's Mom?, Dawn
Lucas, Grimsly, The Sinnoh Elite 4, The Kanto Elite 4 including Lance, Steven, Zinnia, and probably more I forgot. Yes there is no appearance from Team Aqua or Magma 
because the Groudon-Kyogre events will be triggered a different way, but Rayquaza still plays the same role. Team Rocket Jessie, James, and Meowth will also appear. 

Managing all of these character encounters will be hard as to not seem overbearing, so some characters will appear more than others. This will mostly be based on 3 factors:
- My knowledge of the character to create dialogue and encounters that mirror what the character would actually do
- How much I like the character and want to see them in the game
- How well I think I can fit the character into the storyline

Keep in mind that most of my Pokemon experience is in generations 4 and 5, with some in generations 6 and 7 (but I cant add those features anyway). This means if you are
a gen 3 fan then sorry I guess but a lot of the nostalga for those games will not be here (other than the fact that most graphics are gen 3 I think)

### Changes From Previous Pokemon Games
- New Butcher mechanic (more later)
- New Shadow Pokemon mechanic (read the whole document everything is explained i swear)
- New Lava Fishing mechanic: Essentially just fishing but in Lava for fire types, you cannot surf on Lava
- Added Lava
- TM's can be used infinitely 
- Shiny chance increased fropm 1/8192 to 1/512 since there are no real shiny hunting methods planned
- Pokerus chance increased from 1/32768 to 5/32768
    - Added COVID easter egg
- Added Deep Snow, which will make the player move slower and have wild Pokemon
    - This tile appears on Route 12
- Added a Sand tile for Pokemon Encounters
    - This tile appears in Kalimari Desert
- The AI can now use Revives, Max Revives, Revival Herbs, and Sacred Ash. Good luck fighting Cynthia now :)
    - If you can heal so can they it is fair 
    - No I will not remove the feature (Unless an upgrade to the essentials package forces me to but I might just not upgrade)
    - Yes I will make sure it is still balanced
- Added custom music for Darkrai, Latios/Latias, Galandart, Celebi, The Champion Battle, Team Russia Battles, and more
    - I cannot make music because I simply do not know anything about it, see the credits file for full credits on Music, Sprites, and other game functions/details
    - On a side note, most music is taken from generations 4 and 5, with some from 6, 7, and 8 (if 8 is sword and shield idk I have one song from there)
- There will be items that will replace the HM's you earn from gyms. These items will be unlocked after you've already gotten the HM, so HM's will not be useless. I plan on making
the move deleter accessible early in the game for convenience (Surely I wont forget I said this).
- Honey trees will not have a waiting time, the encounter will be instant
- In case you didn't pick up on it, all Pokemon will be catchable without trade with other players (Wondertrade might be needed though. Again, more on that later)

### Changes to Previous Pokemon
#### Slaking
The first Pokemon that has been changed is Slaking because I've always hated the fact that he is unusable. To help with this, his ability has been replaced, but he has been nerfed
to have the power level of a Pseudolegendary. This might be nerfed more later. If you want to argue that he is in fact usable then my coutnerarguemnt is I am bad at the game.

New Ability: Intimidate

EVs: 2 HP, 1 Attack

|  Old Base Stats  |  New Base Stats  |	
| ---------------- | ---------------- |		
| HP - 150 | HP - 120 |
| Attack - 160 | Attack - 140 |
| Defense - 100	| Defense - 90 |
|Sp. Attack - 95 | Sp. Attack - 85 |
|Sp. Defense - 65 | Sp. Defense - 65 |
|Speed - 100 | Speed - 100 |
|TOTAL = 670 | TOTAL = 600 |

#### Arceus
For being literally God, Arceus' base stats are not as impresive as they should be. While there is not Mega Evolution in the game (remember the whole can't add gen 6 thing),
I still wanted to buff Arceus as having an Arceus and being able to sweep is not something I am worried about. All of Arceus' stats have been bosted to be 135 each for a 
base total of **810** instead of the previous total of 720.

#### Evolutions
This game has no online functionality because obviously. To make up for this, all Pokemon are catchable in-game. This also means that some evolution tactics will need to be changed
since they required trading. I could just keep most trading evolutions and have NPC trades, but I thought this would be an easier solution for the player. Let me know if you disagree
and I will consider reverting some of these changed. Also, generation 5 has some ridiculously late evolutions, so I have changed some of them so that the player does not have to wait
until level 60+ to use a Pokemon they like. The followign list gives exact details to new evolution methods for various Pokemon:

---Feebas---
